  Team-Information is a great tool to use when you need to create a quick html website based off criteria entered in on the CLI. In this application we will be using the CLI inquirer package in order to prompt the user to create their respective work team.

  ##  Usage instructions  

***
    
  From the CLI, you will run the command "node index.js" in order to spin the application up. Once it is running, you will be prompted with questions that will need to be answered in order to create the HTML page. Once you are done adding employees, the application will take the data and write in into an HTML page with the information entered.
